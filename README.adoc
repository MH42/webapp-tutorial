* http://junit.org/[JUnit] for Java unit and integration testing
* https://code.google.com/p/mockito/[Mockito] for Mocking
* http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle] as build system
* NPM, Grunt, Bower, TSG for the web client build

== Requirements

* Java 7 or 8 (JDK) installed
* Node.js installed
** Grunt CLI installed (npm install -g grunt-cli)
** Bower installed (npm install -g bower)
** TSD installed (npm install -g tsd)

In the vagrant directory you find a Vagrantfile to create a (German) development environment.

* Log in as vagrant/vagrant and then invoke: startx
* The latest Ubuntu with a simple desktop will start up
* You find this project at /home/vagrant/webapp-tutorial
* All Gradle and JavaScript dependencies are already in the VM
* You find an IntelliJ IDEA trial under /opt
* Before starting IntelliJ you have to configure the Java 8 JDK
* After starting IntelliJ you have to install the Lombok plugin manually.

== Getting Started

When you want to run the tutorial locally, prepare all the labs:
* ./gradlew prepareJs (invokes npm install, bower install, tsd reinstall on all JavaScript projects)
* ./gradlew clean build (builds all the tutorial labs (Java parts), runs all the Java tests)
